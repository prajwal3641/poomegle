## The basics

Video chatting with strangers can be fun, but you gotta be smart about it. Here's what you need to know.

## 1. Protect your info

Never share your:
- Full name
- Address or location
- Phone number
- Social media handles
- Workplace/school

Use a nickname. That's what the name field is for.

## 2. Watch your background

Before you start, check what's behind you. Personal photos, mail, anything with your address - move it.

## 3. Trust your gut

Someone making you uncomfortable? Skip. It's that simple. You don't owe anyone a conversation.

## 4. Don't click random links

If someone sends you a link in chat, don't click it. Ever. Just don't.

## 5. Know when to leave

If things get weird, just close the tab. You can always come back later.

## Bottom line

Common sense goes a long way. Be friendly but smart. Pomegle is meant to be fun - keep it that way.
