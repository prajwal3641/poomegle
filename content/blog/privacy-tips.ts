## Staying anonymous

Pomegle doesn't require signup. But there are more things you can do to stay private.

## 1. Use a VPN

Masks your IP address. Good ones cost money, but worth it if privacy matters to you.

## 2. Username strategy

Don't use your real name. Don't use your usual username. Make something up.

## 3. Background check

Look behind you. Anything identifying? Remove it.

- Photos with faces
- Mail/packages with addresses
- School/work logos
- Unique artwork or furniture

## 4. Browser hygiene

Use incognito/private mode. Clear cookies after.

## 5. Don't overshare

Easy to forget in conversation, but:
- Don't mention your workplace by name
- Don't say what school you go to
- Don't give your city/neighborhood

"I'm from the east coast" > "I'm from Brooklyn"

## 6. Think before showing

Your room, your view, your stuff - all gives information. Be mindful.

## Why bother?

Random chat is fun BECAUSE it's anonymous. Keep it that way.
