## We tested them all

Since Omegle died, a bunch of alternatives popped up. Some good, most garbage. Here's our honest ranking.

## 1. Pomegle

Yeah, we're biased. But also:
- Free, actually
- No signup
- Works on mobile
- Modern UI

## 2. OmeTV

Decent, but:
- Requires registration
- Has ads
- Premium features locked

## 3. Chatroulette

The OG. But:
- Interface is ancient
- Moderation is... lacking

## 4. Emerald Chat

Interest-based matching. But:
- Needs signup for most features
- Smaller user base

## 5. Monkey App

Mobile-focused. But:
- No web version
- Download required

## The rest

Chatspin, Shagle, Tinychat, etc. - they exist. Nothing special.

## Our pick

Pomegle. Obviously. But try them all and decide for yourself.
