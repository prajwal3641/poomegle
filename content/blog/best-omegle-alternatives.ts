## We tested them all

Since Omegle shut down in November 2023, a bunch of alternatives popped up. Some good, most garbage. We spent weeks testing them. Here's our honest ranking.

## 1. Pomegle

Yeah, we're biased. But also:

- **100% free** - No hidden costs, no premium tiers
- **No signup required** - Just click and chat
- **Works on mobile** - No app download needed
- **Modern UI** - Clean, fast, and actually works
- **Worldwide connections** - Chat with people from anywhere

**The catch:** We're new, so user base is growing. But quality over quantity, right?

## 2. OmeTV

Decent, but has issues:

- Requires registration (email/phone)
- Has ads everywhere
- Premium features locked behind paywall
- Mobile app is clunky

**Verdict:** Works, but feels like they're trying to squeeze money out of you.

## 3. Chatroulette

The OG random video chat. But:

- Interface hasn't changed since 2009
- Moderation is... lacking (to put it nicely)
- Lots of bots and inappropriate content
- No mobile optimization

**Verdict:** Nostalgic, but showing its age.

## 4. Emerald Chat

Interest-based matching is cool. But:

- Needs signup for most features
- Smaller user base = longer wait times
- Can feel empty sometimes

**Verdict:** Good concept, execution needs work.

## 5. Monkey App

Mobile-focused. But:

- No web version at all
- Download required (not browser-based)
- Limited to mobile users only

**Verdict:** Great if you only use mobile, terrible if you want flexibility.

## The rest

Chatspin, Shagle, Tinychat, Camsurf, etc. - they exist. Nothing special. Most are either:

- Full of ads
- Require payment for basic features
- Have terrible moderation
- Look like they're from 2010

## Our pick

**Pomegle. Obviously.**

But seriously, try them all and decide for yourself. What matters to you?

- **Free and simple?** → Pomegle
- **Don't mind ads?** → OmeTV
- **Want the classic experience?** → Chatroulette
- **Mobile-only?** → Monkey App

---

**Pro tip:** Most of these sites have the same user base. If you're not finding good matches on one, you probably won't on others either. The platform doesn't matter as much as timing and luck.

Good luck out there! 🎲
