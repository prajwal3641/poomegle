## The unwritten rules

Random video chat has norms. Breaking them makes you "that person."

Don't be that person.

## Before you start

- Camera works? Check.
- Mic works? Check.
- Good lighting? Check.
- Background isn't a disaster? Check.

## During the chat

### Do:
- Look at the camera (not yourself)
- Respond to what they say
- Skip politely if it's not working out

### Don't:
- Eat on camera
- Look at your phone
- Have other conversations
- Be naked (why do we need to say this)

## The skip button

Use it. That's what it's for.

Not every match is a good match. No need to force it.

## If someone is being weird

Skip. Report if it's really bad. Move on.

Don't engage with weirdness. Don't try to "fix" people.

## The golden rule

Treat strangers like you'd want to be treated.

Revolutionary, I know.
