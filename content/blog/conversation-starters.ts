## The awkward hello

We've all been there. Camera turns on. Stranger appears. Silence.

Here's how to not make it weird.

## Don't overthink it

Seriously. "Hey, what's up?" works. "Where are you from?" works. 

The bar is low. Just say something.

## Good openers

- "What brought you to Pomegle?"
- "Anything interesting happen today?"
- "What are you procrastinating on right now?"
- "Any show recommendations?"

## Things that don't work

- "Hi" then staring
- Asking for social media immediately
- Starting with "are you a bot?"
- Any pickup line. Ever.

## Read the room

Some people want to talk for hours. Some want to say hi and move on. Both are fine.

If they're giving one-word answers, just skip. No hard feelings.

## The secret

Be genuinely curious. Ask follow-up questions. Share your own stuff too.

That's it. That's the whole secret.
