## What happened to Omegle?

Omegle shut down in November 2023 after 14 years. The founder said he couldn't keep fighting the moderation battle.

RIP to a legend.

## So now what?

That's where Pomegle comes in.

Same concept: random video chat with strangers. One click, instant connection.

## How we're different

| | Omegle | Pomegle |
|---|---|---|
| Status | Dead | Alive |
| UI | 2009 vibes | Actually modern |
| Mobile | Barely worked | Works great |
| Registration | None | None |
| Cost | Free | Free |

## The real talk

We built Pomegle because we missed what Omegle was supposed to be - random, spontaneous conversations with strangers.

No algorithms. No matching based on interests. Just pure chaos.
